- Allow anyone to use someone else's invite code without permission. 

## 1.3 Use Cases
1. Owner set time start or end.
2. User binding other user as its inviter. and generate a invitation code. if not inviter, can use default code binding to inviter.
## 2. Technical Requirements

## 2.1 Architecture Diagram
## 2.2 Contract Information
### 2.2.1 Relationship.sol
A token holder contract that will allow a user to invite other users to receive rewards.
### 2.2.2 Assets
Relationship.sol has two Structs:
- Invitee: Invitee is the address of the person being invited

  - Invitee[] inviteeList - InviteeList is the list of people invited by the user
  - address inviter - Inviter is the address of the person who invited
  - bytes code - Code is the invitation code
  - mapping(address => uint256) indexes - Indexes is the index of the invitee in the inviteeList

Besides the mentioned structs, the following entities are present in the project:
- **_relations** - address <-> User mapping, User is the address of the person who is invited
- **_codeUsed** - bytes <-> address mapping, code used to invite

### 2.2.3 Events
- Binding - Emitted when a user invite a new user.

### 2.2.4 Modifiers
- inDuration - The function can only be called when the time is not over.

## 2.3 Functions
